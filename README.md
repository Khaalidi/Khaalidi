## 👨‍💻 About Me

**FOSS Enthusiast | FreeBSD Beast | Electronics Hobbyist | Maker**

Passionate about open-source software and low-level systems engineering.  
I explore embedded systems, FPGA design, networking, Linux, DevOps, firewalls, virtualization, and cloud technologies.

From microcontrollers and IoT projects to FreeBSD servers and homelab/data-center labs — I build, break, fix, and share.
